easy. When your pod dropped you off on earth, you didn't even speak our language, and
you felt like an alien in crazy-land. You've always seen where the broken parts of the
world are, and using your laser-like brain, you've invented new ways to work, be, see,
and do. Your brain is so flexible, 'Plastic Fantastic' doesn't
even cover it: you simply bend, and never break. People make tee shirts with pictures of
your brain on it... watch out!"
