    strong "Fearless Focus Freak On!"
    p "You're brave, focused, and can handle stress in the moment to get what you
want, like, GET WHAT YOU WANT (all Caps, thank you)... and yet, you're not a total jerk.
How do you do that? Have a way of winning the prize, gathering a crowd, and breaking
records while still being a friend? Oh, you can focus like a laser beam – to the degree
that just thinking about it SO MUCH seems to make people do it? Wow, all that and people
want to have a beer with you – that is, if you're of age! Or, watch you do it!"
    p "You are also a lot like world famous game designer Lorne Lanning! Some of his
Superpowers are intense perceptual expertise, battling fear, and creating something out
of nothing! Sound like you? Watch the video with Lorne and Kevin to remind yourself how
great a brain you have."
